- 👋 Hi, I’m @NtoLnXBA01
- 👀 I’m interested in "The Great Out Doors" and survival in my spare time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can about personal digital privacy, cyber security, and coding. I am also getting into open source; created my first Fedora Linux machine after multiple fails @ Arch Linux.
- I still have not dipped my toes into AI yet, but I am attempting to learn the basics (I think)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything anyone is willing to teach me about. I have been doing a ton of research on getting into a cyber based employment opportunity and would love the experience and fill in the holes of being self taught. 
- 📫 You can reach me @ GitHubUSRLnXFdR@proton.me
